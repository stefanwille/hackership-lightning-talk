## Hackership

Hackership is a hands on, self-directed learning retreat for developers.

Idea: Take what happens at OpenTechSchool and RailsGirls and extend the approach to fulltime.

Become a better developer

In a distraction-free learning environment together with peers, 4 days per week. Built with the values of OpenTechSchool in mind, Hackership provides an open and welcoming learning environment focussed on progress for everyone.
